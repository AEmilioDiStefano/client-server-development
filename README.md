## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I make my programs maintainable, readable, and adaptable in a number of ways.  In order to hadhere to object-oriented prgoramming principles, I always make sure to compartmentalize the functionality of my programs into methods which are adaptable and reusable in other programs and projects.  This helps me save time by using code from previous projects in new projects after of course first reviewing functionality and making any necessary adjustments based on new knowledge or updates to libraries or dependencies.  In the interest of fostering maintainability, I make sure to add a comprehensive series of comments above or aside as many lines of my code as possible without redundancy.  This practice facilitates the use and modification of my programs by others and helps me to easily review my own code as well. 

In my development of the CRUD module for Project One, my consistent and comprehensive commenting made it so that I could quickly and easily modify the code as needed as new project requirements came to light.  Furthermore, each of my functions for the creation, reading, updating and deleting of MongoDB files and documents could easily be placed into other similar middleware modules and programs.  I engaged in similar practices in my development of the front-end dashboard for Project Two, where I used the aforementioned CRUD module to program seamless communication between the Dash front-end and the MongoDB back-end of the program.

I will certianly use this CRUD module for reference in the future, and may even use it in the full-stack development of applications.  

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My addressing of problems as a computer scientist depends on the nature of the problem.  When I encounter errors or exceptions, I carefully review exception and/or error messages and performing research relevant to the information gleaned from these error messages.  When my code runs successfully but yields incorrect or undesired results, my first step is always to review my code for any logical errors.  In both cases, I then check the documentation for the languages, libraries, and modules being used.  This usualy yields the answer to my questions regarding the problem, but if the documentation does not provide me with a solution then I use optimized search tactics to scan the internet for articles and reposts of other who have been having similar issues.  

The issues encountered during my addressing of Grazioso Salvare's requirements in the development of the K9Recruit rescue animal recruitment program mostly related to connectivity and correct configuration of user permissions.  My problem solving in my completion of some of the more simple assignments which I have worked on in previous courses involved less focus on documentation and more focus on websites and blogs such as StackExchange and Geeks for Geeks, but the complex nature of the assignments for this course meant that others were less likely to have come acorss the same issues as I had been experienging.  This forced me to check the documentation for the languages, libraries, and modules being used.  I am glad to have reached the point as a software developer where the issues which I come across are so unique that the documentation has become a much more useful resource than blogs and programming websites. 

The invaluable information and training which I recieved in this course will certainly prove incredibly useful in helping me to meet other client requests, and I will certainly be implementing the aforementioned techniques during my development of future projects.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists play an incredibly important role in the development and maintenance of the modern world at large.  Our work enables individuals and organizations across
